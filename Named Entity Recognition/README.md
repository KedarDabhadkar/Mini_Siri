A huge dataset of about 50,000 sentences has been analyzed for making a Named Entity Recognition product. This length is about 10x as much as the length of a mid-size book (ref). The final aim is to assign tags to each and every word. The dataset has been obtained from this Kaggle database. We selectively use the first column, which gives the individual words and the third column, which gives the corresponding tags for our feature engineering experiments.
